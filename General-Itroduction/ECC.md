# Elliptic Curve Cryptography: a gentle introduction

Those of you who know what public-key cryptography is may have already heard of

- **ECC**
- **ECDH** 
- **ECDSA**

***The first is an acronym for Elliptic Curve Cryptography, the others are names for algorithms based on it.***

Before ECC become popular, almost all public-key algorithms were based on RSA, DSA, and DH, alternative cryptosystems based on modular arithmetic.
